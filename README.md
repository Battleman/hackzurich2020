## Why we built it

We wanted to help people who don't take their health life seriously.

## What does it do

It connects people who wish to motivate less sporty people, with couch-potatoes. With the money incentive, everyone can receive certain financial reward(either cash or not) by exercising.

## How we built it

The web app is powered by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). Tech stack we used include but not limit to: bootstrap css3, html5, javascript, jquery, opencv, posenet, python, sqlite, tensorflow;
